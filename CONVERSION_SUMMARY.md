## Backend Compatibility

### âœ… Enhanced API Endpoints
Added mobile-specific endpoints to the existing backend:
- `POST /api/notifications/push-token` - Register push tokens
- `GET /api/family/members` - Mobile-friendly family list
- `GET /api/family/locations` - Real-time family locations
- `POST /api/family/invite-code` - Generate invite codes
- `DELETE /api/family/members/:id` - Remove family member
- `PUT /api/places/:id` - Update places
- `GET /api/locations/history` - Paginated location history

### âœ… Cross-Platform Features
- **iOS Support**: Native permissions, background location, maps
- **Android Support**: Native permissions, background location, maps
- **Expo Go Testing**: Development testing on physical devices
- **EAS Build**: Production builds for App Store and Google Play
